# Witness Format Spec Pointer (Normative Index)

Version: 0.1  
Status date: 2026-02-11

The current witness format specification is maintained at:

- `meta/design/compiler/witness-format.md`

Normative policy:

1. Witness identity MUST be computed from canonical identity bytes.
2. Projection JSON is non-authoritative.
3. Schema ids for emitted witnesses MUST be explicit.

Until full migration, `meta/design/compiler/witness-format.md` remains the canonical detailed schema source.
